 - Co-developed a Python program that orchestrates the precise positioning of autoclaves to place in their designated sterilizers using the Quanser simulation environment. The movement and coordination of the Q-Arm robotic system are facilitated through the utilization of two potentiometers, as illustrated in the accompanying image.
